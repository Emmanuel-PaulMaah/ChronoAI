# ChronoAI
See AI develop through time

Static site: HTML + Tailwind + vanilla JS. Fetches Wikipedia summaries for events listed in JSON.

## To run locally
- Put `index.html` and the three `ai-*.json` files in the repo root.
- Serve with a static server (or open `index.html` directly, but some browsers restrict local fetch).
  - Quick: `python -m http.server` then open http://localhost:8000

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Push to a repo and enable GitHub Pages from `main` branch / `root` folder.
